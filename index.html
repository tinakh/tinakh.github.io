                    The Victorian period in Britain (mid to late-19th century) witnessed an abundance of new movements in art and science. The Arts & Crafts Movement sought to revive traditional handicrafts, argued that quality objects are produced through pleasurable work and advocated the design theory in which form follows function. This movement does not only suggest an artistic style but also socialist issues, for it developed as a reaction to the Industrial Revolution. After Charles Darwin (1809-1882) published On the Origin of Species (1859), the concepts of “adaptation,” “fitness,” and “functionalism” were just as relevant to design as it was to evolutionary biology. For example, Darwin put a great emphasis on studying peacocks to prove his idea that secondary sexual characteristics developed out of a need to attract a mate with whom to reproduce. However, he encountered many obstacles in finding an ornithological artist to who could visualize this process. Peacocks were also the subject of the notable Arts & Crafts designer, William De Morgan (1839-1917), most well known for his painted tiles and contributions to the illustrations in Lewis Carroll’s Alice in Wonderland. Here, I will attempt to show how artists commissioned by Darwin attempted to visualize his theory of evolution through peacocks and how those prints compare to the peacocks represented on the painted ceramic wares by De Morgan.
